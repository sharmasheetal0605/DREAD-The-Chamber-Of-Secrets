            Nestled amidst peaceful countryside, in a quiet part of Kent you’ll find the picturesque village of Pluckley,<br> famously used as the backdrop in the 1990s for shooting of The Darling Buds of May.<br> Despite appearances, Pluckley is widely considered one of the most haunted places in Kent, and across England.<br>

            Looking at this this pretty place, you might find it hard to believe <br>that it was once named the Most Haunted Village in Britain in the Guinness Book of World Records in 1989.<br> An astounding 12-16 distinctive ghosts have been reported to reside in the village so it’s easy to see why it’s so popular for ghost-hunters hoping to catch a sighting.<br>
            
            Amongst Pluckley’s numerous ghostly tales is that of The Watercress Woman who witnesses<br> have reported to have seen sitting on Pinnock Bridge smoking her pipe. The elderly woman was well-known <br>in the village for making a living gathering watercress from the river and selling it to the villagers. It is said that one evening, <br>after drinking, she fell asleep and her pipe dropped onto her clothing, within moments she was consumed by the flames.<br> She is believed to still haunt Pinnock Bridge with some witnesses describing a faint pink glow which hovers in the air above the spot where she died.<br>
            
            Many have travelled to Pluckley in the hopes of capturing evidence of spirits,<br> and one such group asked to spend a night in the village’s Church of St. Nicholas in the 1970s, <br>bringing along cameras and tape recorders to document their stay. The story goes that the next morning when <br>the vicar of the church came to greet them, they were disappointed that the night had been uneventful and commented <br>that the only interesting part had been the Vicar’s dog who had come to visit them a few times, to which the vicar replied that he did not have a dog!<br>
            
            Visit Pluckley to see for yourself why it was given the title of the most haunted village in Britain,<br> as there are a number of ghost walks and tours held here throughout the year.<br> Or, visit to appreciate this quintessentially-English village that’s surrounded by beautiful countryside.<br>
