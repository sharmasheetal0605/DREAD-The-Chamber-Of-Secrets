         <p>The Masonic Temple in Detroit, Michigan, is often considered one of the most haunted places in the United States<br> due to a combination of its rich history, eerie architecture, and numerous reported paranormal experiences.<br>
            There may be many haunted towns in America but Detroit is one of a kind.<br> Famous for being home to the worldâ€™s most biggest Masonic Temple, little do the travelers know until <br>they get here that the site is haunted by the ghost of its architect, George D. Mason. As mystical as it looks, the temple houses hidden passages, secret staircases, <br>and just about 1000 rooms with a facade so Gothic, that the construction of this massive temple turned George Mason totally bankrupt. And as a result of this, <br>it is believed that he jumped off from the roof of this 16-storeyed temple leaving his soul behind.<br>
